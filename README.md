## Sorting
### Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm used to sort an array;

It works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and then recursively sorting the subarrays.

### Time complexity
* O(n2) - This is the true worst-case scenario.

  
* O(n log n) - When using a random pivot or a middle pivot, it is extremely unlikely to fall into the O(n²) case.

### Space Complexity

* O(log n)
Due to recursive function calls (call stack).


* O(n)
When recursion becomes highly unbalanced
