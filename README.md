# DSA Studies 📚

This repository is for my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice.

I’m using it to:
- Implement algorithms
- Solve problems (e.g., LeetCode)
- Study and practice DSA concepts

## Sorting - Algorithms
### Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm used to sort an array with recursion;
It works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and then recursively sorting the subarrays.

* Time complexity: O(n2) or O(n log n) (When using a random pivot or a middle pivot, it is extremely unlikely to fall into the O(n²) case.).


* Space Complexity: O(log n) or O(n) (when recursion becomes highly unbalanced)

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm used to sort arrays.
It works by repeatedly passing through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
This process continues until the array is fully sorted.

* Time complexity: O(n2)


* Space Complexity: O(n)
